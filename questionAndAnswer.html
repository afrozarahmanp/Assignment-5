                    <p class="m-3 text-lg">A programming interface or tree-like representation of the web page that is loaded
                        into the browser is called the Document Object Model, or DOM.
                        It gives us the ability to add, modify, or eliminate elements from a website document.
                        Because the DOM refers to the page as a collection of nodes and objects, programming languages
                        can interact with it.</p>

                        methods.</h3>
                    <p class="m-3 text-lg">There are 5 ways in which you can select elements in a DOM using selectors.
                    <ol class="m-3 text-lg">
                        <li>getElementsByTagName()</li>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold opacity-75">What is event bubble?</h3>
                    <p class="m-3 text-lg">A particular method of DOM event propagation known as "event bubbling" involves the
                        event first triggering on the target element that is the furthest away from the event source,
                        and then moving outward through the target element's parents until it reaches the outermost DOM
                        element or document object.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold opacity-75">What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h3>
                    <p class="m-3 text-lg">In order to complete a task or activity, a callback function is a function that
                        accepts an argument from another function and is then called from inside the outer function.
                        Callbacks guarantee that a function will execute right when a task is finished, not before it.
                        It assists in writing asynchronous JavaScript code and shields us from problems and mistakes.
